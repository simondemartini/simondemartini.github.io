Hey there! I am Simon DeMartini, a computer nerd with a passion for working with modern technologies to make tools and systems easier to use through automation -- either for external users or internal developers. My passion stems from a love of open source systems and communities, user experience and design, as well as software development. In my (limited) spare time, I thoroughly enjoy breaking fixing things all things computer related to see how they work.

Currently, I am a Computer Science & Systems major at the University of Washington Tacoma, planned to graduate in Fall 2017.  If you have any questions or comments, feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simondemartini) or check out my [Github](https://github.com/simondemartini) page.
