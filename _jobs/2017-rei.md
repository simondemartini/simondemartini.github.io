Working with the Platform Engineering Team, I contributed bug fixes, features, and tests for the tools, libraries and applications used by REIâ€™s DevOps and CI/CD systems. Major contributions include:

- Automated code freezes by integrating with the continuous delivery pipeline to provide additional checkpoints during high-traffic periods. Documented and presented my solutions to IT management and internal development community.  
- Enabled easy deployment rollback, added additions to identify app startup errors and fixed bugs in the deployment and infrastructure management tool for both on-prem and AWS apps.
- Contributed to discussions about a public engineering site and internal engineering culture.
